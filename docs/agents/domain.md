# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root.
- `docs/adr/` for decisions that touch the area being changed.

If any of these files do not exist, proceed silently. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions get resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
└── docs/adr/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. If a needed concept is missing, note it for `/grill-with-docs`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly instead of silently overriding it.
